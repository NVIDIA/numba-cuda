Numba-CUDA
==========

Numba-CUDA provides a CUDA target for the Numba Python JIT Compiler. It is used
for writing SIMT kernels in Python, for providing Python bindings for
accelerated device libraries, and as a compiler for user-defined functions in
accelerated libraries like `RAPIDS <https://rapids.ai>`_.

* To install Numba-CUDA, see: :ref:`numba-cuda-installation`.
* To get started writing CUDA kernels in Python with Numba, see
  :ref:`writing-cuda-kernels`.
* Browse the :ref:`numba-cuda-examples` to see a variety of use cases of Numba-CUDA.
